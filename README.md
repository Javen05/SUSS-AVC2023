## HDB Resales Analysis

### About Dashboard:
After going through a school-based module that taught me Tableau, I decided to explore on how I can improve on the Dashboard I made for this hackathon with my newly acquired understanding and skills regarding data visualization, such as using a map chart and filters to provide opportunities for user to explore and discover insights when they interact with the Dashboard.
